Astronaut                </h3>
                <p>I have a dream to become an astronaut when I grow up. An astronaut is a person who goes to space in a spacecraft and study the universe.

                    The reason why I want to become an astronaut is because I love the sky, stars, planets, asteroids. It looks like a mystery to me and I want to know more about it. I want to know how it feels like and how it looks like above the sky. I see the sun, moon stars in the sky in the morning and at night. They all look so beautiful but very far. I feel like I want to go and see them from close or touch their land. I want to know how far is the moon, how hot is the sun and how many stars are there.
                    Once I saw an astronaut on tv and she showed how everything was flowing in the space. When she poured water from the bottle, it flew upward in many drops. All that was looking like a magic to me and I want to do it too. I also love the suit and helmet that the astronauts wear because it looks very strong and powerful.

I want to be an astronaut so that I can know if life is possible on any other planet. I want to send information about other galaxies, black holes, stars and other planets on my planet Earth. This will help scientists to know about the universe well. When I will become an astronaut, I will see how Earth looks from above because it looks beautiful in pictures. I will contact on my planet and tell everything that I will feel to my family and all people on Earth. I will value my planet more when I will come back.

                    What is programming?
                                </h2>
                <p>There are countless definitions of what computer programming is, but here is mine.

                    “Programming is how you get computers to solve problems.”
                    
                    There are two key phrases here that are important:
                    
                    You: without the programmer (you), the computer is useless. It does what you tell it to do.
                    Solve problems: computers are tools. They are complex tools, admittedly, but they are not mysterious or magical: they exist to make tasks easier.
                    A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

                <p> From Python to machine learning and AI, a Microsoft representative dives into the myriad ways coding has buttressed exploration in the past with an eye toward the future </p>
         <img src="nasa-3.jpg" alt="image" width="680" height="500">
          <p>The last few months have been exciting times for space enthusiasts around the globe. Last fall, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft momentarily touched down on asteroid Bennu and collected samples of its surface during a “touch-and-go” millions of miles from Earth. In February, NASA successfully landed its latest rover on Mars and another roving bot is set to join Perseverance on our celestial neighbor later this year. Coding is an integral part of modern space exploration and educational pathways could help aspiring scientists enable tomorrow’s missions with artificial intelligence, machine learning and more.

            SEE: Linux commands for user management (TechRepublic Premium)
            
            “Coding has been a part of space exploration since its inception and will only continue to play a more crucial role,” said Sarah Guthals, Ph.D., a principal program manager for developer relations at Microsoft. “Software is enabling us to explore, discover and learn about our planet and universe safely.”
            
            As a result of these efforts, Guthals said developers worldwide are able to map asteroids to “discover what materials might be present in which locations for future collection,” predict radiation to protect astronauts on the moon, and provide open source projects with access to “petabytes of Earth science data” to study our home planet.
        
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3asp">Coding in the final frontier
        </h3>
        <p>

            In September, Microsoft in partnership with NASA announced a number of coding lessons, modules and learning paths focused on space exploration. There are also educational offerings based around the “role of Python in space exploration” as well as a space-focused introduction to the programming language.

            “This course not only gives you an introduction to one of the most popular and used programming languages; it also introduces you to innovation like AI and ML and the tools professional developers use, such as Visual Studio Code and Python notebooks,” Guthals said.
            
            “What better way to be authentically introduced to an entire industry than through the inspiring perspective of space exploration?” she continued.

            Within this introduction to Python, aspiring coders are able to gain a better understanding of NASA’s Artemis program, which is set to place a man and a woman on the moon by 2024. Other pathways allow STEM students to use data science and coding to help create solutions for exploration challenges ranging from strategies for rock sample collection to forecasting rocket launches years in advance.
            
            “NASA is pleased to work with external organizations to create innovative, high quality offerings for students,” said Rob LaSalvia, the partnerships manager for the Office of STEM Engagement at NASA. “Through our collective work with partners we focused on making meaningful impacts in the lives of students and teachers and creating the Artemis generation.”

                    Programming languages

                </h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, computers don’t understand languages like English or Spanish, so we have to use a programming language they understand to give them instructions.

 

            There are many different programming languages, all of which have their own merits, and certain languages are better suited to particular types of tasks, but there is no one language that is the ‘best’.
            
             
            
            In this course, you will be programming using a language called Python. Python is one of a group of languages called “general-purpose programming languages”, which can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Other popular languages in this category are C, Ruby, Java and BASIC.</p>

                <p class="pside"> Astronauts are highly trained individuals who are selected by space agencies such as NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA and CNSA among others, to travel into space to perform various tasks such as scientific research, satellite repair, and space station maintenance. They are also responsible for operating and maintaining the spacecraft in which they travel.

                    Becoming an astronaut requires extensive training in areas such as physics, engineering, medicine, and survival skills. The selection process is rigorous and competitive, with only a small percentage of applicants being selected. Astronauts must also meet certain physical and medical requirements, such as good vision and the ability to withstand the physical demands of space travel.
                    
                    Astronauts have been sent on a wide variety of missions, including orbiting the Earth, landing on the Moon, and traveling to other planets. They have also been sent to live and work on space stations such as the International Space Station (ISS). </p>  </div>
